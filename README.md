# About
Hii, I am Faith, I have an academic background in Economics and I am currently completing a Master’s degree in Data Analytics at Dublin Business School. My interest lies in the intersection of data, economic policy, and social impact. I am passionate about using data to uncover insights that inform better decision-making, particularly in areas that support inclusive development.

Through my academic and personal projects, I have gained hands-on experience in working with real-world datasets, building visualizations, and applying statistical techniques to address complex problems. My training has equipped me with both technical proficiency and the ability to communicate findings in a clear, actionable way.

In my free time, I enjoy reading books on behavioral economics, exploring public datasets, and learning new tools in data analytics. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I’m motivated by the opportunity to use data to drive meaningful change.
